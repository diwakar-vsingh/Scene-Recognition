The color jittering is implemented using function torchvision.transforms.ColorJitter() followed by mirroring which is implemented using the function torchvision.transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(p=0.5), where p=0.5 means half of the images will be mirrored. This is helpful as it causes the network not to overfit on the original training images. Also, we can synthetically increase our amount of training data by left-right mirroring training images during the learning process. \n",

    "1. Conv2d: It applies a 2D convolution over an input image composed of several channels. More specifically, the convolution layer computes the output of neurons that are connected to local regions in the input, each computing a dot product between their weights and a small region they are connected to in the input volume. In particular, the transformations performed are a function of not only the activations in the input volume but also of the parameters (the weights and biases of the neurons). \n",
    "\n",
    "2. ReLU: RELU layer applies an elementwise activation function, such as the max(0,x) thresholding at zero. This leaves the size of the volume unchanged. It greatly accelerates the convergence of stochastic gradient descent compared to the sigmoid/tanh functions. This can be attributed due to its linear, non-saturating form.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. MaxPool: It performs a downsampling operation along the spatial dimensions (width, height), resulting in the downsampling of the image, to better capture global features. The pooling layer serves to progressively reduce the spatial size of the representation, to reduce the number of parameters, memory footprint and amount of computation in the network, and hence to also control overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Dropout: It is a regularization, used to avoid overfitting. It turns off a certain percentage of activations, to avoid dependency on a few neurons learning most of the model. Although it slightly slows down the learning, the accuracy increase compensates for it. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. BatchNorm2d: Batch Normalization reduces internal covariate shift, and in doing so dramatically accelerates the training of deep neural nets. It accomplishes this via a normalization step that fixes the means and variances of layer inputs. It also has a beneficial effect on the gradient flow through the network, by reducing the dependence of gradients on the scale of the parameters or of their initial values. This allows us to use much higher learning rates without the risk of divergence. Furthermore, batch normalization regularizes the model and reduces the need for Dropout.\n"
